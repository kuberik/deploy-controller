# What is Kuberik?

Kuberik is an open source continuous delivery system for Kubernetes workloads. It aims to provide rich set of reusable components for every step of the software development lifecycle to help developers deliver their changes in the fastest, safest, and most consistent way possible.

::: warning
Kuberik is currently in alpha status. It is already suitable for basic CI/CD, but the API may still change without backwards compatibility which could require manual migration to newer versions.
